As a reminder this project forms 20% of your final grade. *The work you turn in should reflect this.*

## Motivation
The goal of the final project is to show off what you have learned through the semester. Rather than give a final exam, I would rather see your ability expressed through accomplishing a goal using code. This document outlines the basics for the project and how it will be delivered, but you are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond. Work beyond what is expected will be recognized and __extra points will be awarded__.

## General Requirements
For this project, the following requirements must be met:  
  * Use appropriate Object Oriented Programing
  * Use some form of File Input/Output
  * Use appropriate Dynamic Memory

You are going to be defining some problem you are going to be solving with your code. I intentionally want to leave that up to you. Along with this document, I have some ideas listed as inspiration to get started.  

This project will be completed as a group of two. **All code could be written utilizing pair programming**, utilizing whatever appropriate tools (like Live Share). This means that both group members will be actively engaged when code is being worked on. This is not a divide-and-conquer type project. 

All artifacts, with the exception of the reflection sent via email, will be submitted via a group-specific Whitgit repository. For non-code things you are welcome and encouraged to submit links instead of uploading. This includes presentation material, code documentation and design material. Just make sure access settings are correctly set. If I cannot get to it, I cannot grade it! 

---------------------------------

## Project Proposal (Oral)
After some brainstorming, your group should talk to me regarding to the project proposal. I will either give you a thumbs up or a suggestion of how to make the project either more rigorous (the solution would be too easy) or how to re-frame the problem to make is easier to solve (your planned solution is too difficult for this level class).

You don't want to be the person that finds out after the fact that your work on the final project was not sufficient for the class. That is not fun for you or for your professors.

----------------------------------

## Progressive Report (Oral)
During the time of May 6 through May 13, students are expected to come to the class meeting. Each group should talk to me at least twice with both members present. I will check in your progress and give you some comments and feedback. This makes sure that the project is on the right track and progresses well.

## Deliverables

### Documentation
You will submit a document (.md, .docx, .pdf) in this repository that contains the following:
* Detailed project description. What is this project? What is it doing? What is the context of creating it? What is its purpose?
* An accounting of any assumptions made both when designing the project or when running the program. This could be things like a file format you are using or assumptions about the user's actions. If I don't know something and can make a reasonable assumption and it breaks your code, you didn't document well.
* UML Diagrams for any classes utilized, in particular the interaction between them.
* Detailed analysis, overview and justification of your design. Why did you develop your code the way you did? I would suggest using diagrams. Showing is often easier than telling.  
* Detailed manual for how to run your project. Imagine a technically competent person is using your program, but knows nothing specific about it.
* Works Cited. This includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should be mirrored in your code. Remember to keep in mind approved sources for the course.
  
This document should be 1500-2000 words minimum leaving out the UML diagrams. A single sentence for each of the above bullets is not what I am looking for.

Included in your documentation score is the documentation of the code itself. Your code must be appropriately commented. This includes headers for every method/function and file headers.

As a note, detailed means: "having many details or facts; showing attention to detail". This means that I should have _zero_ questions about what you did, how you did it and why. Be a good communicator. Look at how long this document is. This is just the documentation for the framework of the project. Take that into consideration when developing your documentation.

### Presentation
During our final exam slot, you will participate in the presentation of these final projects. You are expected to show respect to your classmates and engage with their cool projects, as they are expected to engage with your presentation. Please prepare slides for the presentation.

At a **minimum** each presentation should:
* outline your project and justify the goal (i.e. why did you do what you did)
* highlight the algorithmic points of your program
* include a demonstration of project running
  * This could be captured (screen shots, video) or live demo
* identify future work on the project
* reflection on the lessons learned
  * what actionable things would you do differently next time
  * 'get to work sooner' or 'do more documentation' are not interesting, give us something that helps understand the problem you worked on

Your presentation **should not be a code review.** Selections of code are fine, but we don't need to see every line of code. We want to see results!

Each class has 2 hours for final presentations. We will be calculating time based on: `2 hours / (numTeams + 1) = presentationTime`. This means if there are 10 teams, each team will get (at most) 12 minutes (minus transition time). Spending less time is ok, but based on the amount you need to cover, I would aim for 8-10 minutes. You have a lot to cover: concise and clear presentations are necessary.  

Make sure all group members participate in the presentation. Showing up without anything prepared or rehearsed is not going to work well for you.

### Project Implementation
As with all code turned in for this class, the same rules apply here for this final project.  

You will be graded on proper coding style. Your code must be readable and have good comments describing what is going on. Variable names should make sense, classes and their methods should be obvious, and variables should be descriptive. Use proper indentation.  

At this point in your CS career you should be able to take advantage proper code re-use, functionalization and abstraction. Each function should only do one thing. If it is doing many things, those should be functionalized. Remember you have the power of templates too.  

Your code should line up with your documentation. All citations should be clearly marked and identified.

### Reflection

Each member of the team needs to submit a personal project reflection survey to your professor. This reflection must be submitted **after** the final project submission, but before the end of finals week.

Your reflection survey should take you more than 30 minutes. You should justify all of the bellow, not just list them out. If it is obviously thrown together at the last minute without thoughtful answers to the questions, you will not get full points. 

You reflection survey (survey link will be sent to you by email) will include questions like the following:
* Argument for evaluation outcome (i.e. what grade do you think you deserve?)
* Reflection on the process
  * What went well?
  * What didn't go well?
  * What would you change if you did this project again?
* Favorite part of the project? What do you feel really good about?
* (if in a team) How did your partner do? 
* (if in a team) What is your evaluation of them?
* (if in a team) What is your evaluation of how good of a teammate you were?
* Any thoughts on how I (as the instructor) can better prepare, set-up or execute the final project in the future?
