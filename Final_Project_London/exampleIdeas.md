# Possible Final Project Ideas
These are not required projects, but merely examples of possible projects. Be creative! I would suggest using these as a 'jumping off point.' Your project should be equal or more complex than the following. Remember, you can always pass ideas past me, and I will give you feedback on it.

## A Humanities Application
Consider a project that analyzes the content of texts. You could make a simple neural network or a simple machine learning model to identify content within different texts.

## A Business Application
For instance, a system might use a number of files and calculate profits (as per purchases, sales, expenses), might calculate payroll, keep track of bank accounts, etc. A program to analyze stock prices and and company information in order to recommend stocks, etc.

## Bias Testing
There has been lots of testing to suggest that humans are really bad at identifying bias, even if we are educated on bias. Project Implicit has a number of online based Implicit Association Tests as an example for this project. Develop a program that reads in categories / good word, bad word lists. Present pairing, then time input from the user. More info can be found: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html

## Data Structures
Consider a project involving more advanced data structures from Chapter 20 and beyond (e.g. linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables/dictionaries, binary trees, etc.)  

## Machine Learning
Now that you know how to deal with files, create a document classifier. Create a program that will be able to detect two different kinds of text. As an example: sports journalism vs. political journalism. You can train your classifier by feeding it known (or labeled) documents. One of the base forms of classifiers is the count the number of occurrences of words in a document and compare it to an average for that kind of document. Basically "baseball" should show up, on average more in a sports article than a political one. Same thing with "representative" showing up, on average, more for political articles.

## Text-based model/simulation
Implement a program that simulates a real-life scenario. Examples are simulating an airport, air traffic scheduling, processes of a hospital, a manufacturing floor, elevators in a skyscraper, a physics problem, a biological model, a societal or anthropological issue, scientific problems.

## Interactive tutoring project
In CS-171 you may have implemented parts of an interactive math tutoring program. Redesign this using Classes/Objects and other advanced concepts you learned this semester. Perhaps you will like to keep track of studentâ€™s progress/scores in files, read and present questions from different topics from files, etc.

## Data Science Application
Is there some data that you have access to? Is there something interesting you can do with that data? You could probably find an online source for most data sets, you just need to think about how to process the data. This could be Finance related, it could be sports relates, it could be healthcare relates. This is a truly open space.

## Other Fields of study
Explore implementing a software solution to an advanced problem in your other classes, i.e. math, chemistry, physics, journalism, etc.

__NOTE__: it is also possible to enhance and expand your previous CS-171 final project or a project for a different class/event. In that case, you must make a good case by talking to your professor before hand. This expansions should significantly change the original code with the more advanced concepts that you have learned this semester. Talk to us!
